#Calculator

##Project Description
This is a simple arithmetic calucator build using html, css and pure javaScript

###Challenge
So far we've been able to build the interface on how the calculator should look like. My challenge for you is to modify the interface to your own taste
and using javascript, integrate the logics operation

###Hint
You guys can work in group and make your personal research online.
